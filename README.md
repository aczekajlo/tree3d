# tree3d: 3D Tree Models

`tree3d` is an R package that provides highly customizable 3D tree
models for data visualization and 3D scene creation. `tree3d` allows you
to generate tree models as OBJ files, which can then easily be
integrated into your data visualization, animation, or 3D rendering
workflows.

## Features

- **Variety of tree models**: Includes both planar and solid tree
  models.

- **Multiple crown types**: Provides a wide range of crown types,
  including: columnar, oval, palm, pyramidal, rounded, spreading, vase,
  and weeping. Each type offers a unique visual aesthetic to represent
  different types of trees.

- **Customizable dimensions and color**: Allows you to adjust the
  diameter, height, and color of both the treeâ€™s crown and trunk
  individually. This flexibility allows you to customize the tree model
  for your specific use case.

## Installation

`tree3d` can currently be installed from Github.

``` r
